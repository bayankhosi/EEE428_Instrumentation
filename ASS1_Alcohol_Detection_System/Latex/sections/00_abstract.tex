\section*{Abstract}
Workplace safety is a critical concern in industrial environments, particularly in compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act, 2001 (No. 9 of 2001) of Eswatini, which mandates safe working conditions for employees. This report presents the design of a Factory Alcohol Detection System to prevent intoxicated employees from entering the workplace. By integrating alcohol detection technology with controlled access, the system ensures compliance with legal standards, reduces workplace hazards, and promotes a safer, more productive environment. The system also logs incidents, aligning with the Act's requirements for hazard monitoring and reporting.
